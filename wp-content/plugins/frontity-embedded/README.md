# Frontity Embedded Mode - [Proof of Concept]

> ⚠️ This is only a proof of concept of the Embedded Mode idea, not the real plugin. Don't use this in production. This mode will be released as part of the upcoming [Frontity WordPress Plugin](https://github.com/frontity/wp-plugins). Once it's released, we will remove/update this proof of concept. If you want to know about the release you can subscribe to our newsletter at https://frontity.org.

## Install

If you want to test it out, you can download the zip file from GitHub.

- [Download the zip](https://github.com/frontity/frontity-embedded-proof-of-concept/archive/master.zip) or clone this repository.
- Unzip the plugin and edit the `includes/template.php` file to add the URL of your Frontity project.

```php
$frontity_server = "https://myfrontityserver.com";
```

- Compress it again and upload it to your WordPress.

## Environment Variables

You can also use an environment variable instead of changing the URL in the code.

```bash
> FRONTITY_SERVER=https://myfrontityserver.com
```

## Static Assets

> **This step won‘t be necessary in the final plugin.**

If you need, you can change the folder or URL where your static assets are stored using the `--public-path` option of the `npx frontity build` command.

### Example: Frontity in the same WordPress server

If you are using the same server for both WordPress and Frontity, and your Frontity project is at `/wp-content/frontity`, your static folder will be at `https://yourdomain.com/wp-content/frontity/build/static`.

You can change the folder when you run `npx frontity build` like this:

```bash
> npx frontity build --public-path /wp-content/frontity/build/static
```

### Example: Frontity in an external server

If you deployed Frontity in an external hosting service, like for example Vercel, you can use the `--public-path` option to point directly to the Vercel URL:

```bash
> npx frontity build --public-path https://myfrontityapp.now.sh/static
```

## Local Development

If you want to use the Embedded mode while you are developing in your local environment, you can do so by using the `--public-path` parameter in the `npx frontity dev` command as well:

```bash
> npx frontity dev --public-path http://localhost:3000/static
```
